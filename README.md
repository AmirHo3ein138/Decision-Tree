### Individual Project â€“ Advanced Programming (IUST)

This project was developed as part of the **Advanced Programming** course at **Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST)** during my **Computer Science major**.  
It is a **fully implemented Decision Tree model built entirely from scratch**, without using any built-in machine learning libraries or functions.  
The project focuses on **detecting basic cyber attacks** such as *Brute Force, Basic Web Attacks, DoS, DDoS, and Botnet activities* using the well-known **CICIDS2017 dataset** (a preprocessed subset of **15,000 records**).  

Key Highlights:
- Complete implementation of a Decision Tree structure in Python.  
- Dataset preprocessing, model construction, prediction, and evaluation.  
- Focused on fundamental concepts of machine learning and cybersecurity.
